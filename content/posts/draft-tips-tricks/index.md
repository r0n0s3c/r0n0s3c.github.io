## Introduction

Hello, I have started to play drafts more consistently on magic arena and I start to lose very quickly because my creatures were not that strong or the synergy was not there. 

Since I'm a very competitive player and I want to get my "money" back every time I play drafts, I made some research on how to improve in drafts and I found a very good [article](https://www.channelfireball.com/article/Stark-Reality-Drafting-the-Hard-Way/397b71cd-11d4-4644-9e77-5c08846d30c0/) by Ben Stark named "Drafting the hard way". Basically the concept is essentially being flexible everytime you draft never sticking to your first picks. 

In the next section I will give tips from the article and give other informations:

## Tips

- **Analyzing each new format** and being willing to forget about whether you like control or beat down, white or black. 
- Forgetting about what was working for you in the last format and starting to **evaluate everything from scratch all over again**.
- Always being **willing to drop early picks** if you realize something else is open.
- It means not sticking to the strategy or strategies that you think are best but weighting the cards that are important for those correctly, and then still being **willing to draft completely different decks if that's what is open**.
- It requires allowing your decks to go different directions in each draft and **not predetermining where you are going to go.**
- The single thing people do that **ruins most drafts is stick to their early picks.**
- You should be trying to **figure out what is underdrafted at the table** so that you can have access to a lot of what you are looking for in packs two and three
- The next thing that often **ruins drafts is trying to draft the nuts or the best deck**. Going for a combo or cards without synergy that don't fit their deck's plan, or are difficult to cast but have a high power level.


## Tricks

- Sometimes in the magic arena shop there are bundles that include draft tokens and gems and if you add the numbers using the drafts prices you will verify that it is worth to buy those one time bundles even if they dont appear more cheap because they bring less gems.
